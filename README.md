# java-algorithms-data-structures

This repository contains solutions for several algorithms and data structures
questions frequently asked in the interviews. The solutions are in Java. You 
can find a link to the original leetcode problem for every solution.

I worked on these solutions from September 2019 to December 2019. Problem 
definitions or method signatures could be changed since then. I wrote most of
the solutions myself, but got some solutions from the leetcode discussion 
section and updated them based on my own understanding and coding style. 

There is no promise or guarantee for the solutions to be correct or optimal.
Use them at your own risk.
